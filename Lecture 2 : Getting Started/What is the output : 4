What is the output of the following code if the input is : 5 15?
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;
  int main() {
        int a, b; 
    cin >> a;
    cin >> b;
    cout << (a+b);
            return 0;
  }
  
  Answer-20
  
 Solution Description
  
We are asking two integer values from user and input is "5 15" (without quotes). So 5 will be assigned to a and 15 will be assigned to b. We can enter multiple input values either separated by space or in new lines. 
Hence, the result will be 20.
