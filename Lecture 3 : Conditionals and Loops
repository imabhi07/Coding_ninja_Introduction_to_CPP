    int x = 5; 
    if (x < 6)

    if(x == 5){
        cout << “Hi ”;
    }
    else { 
        cout << “Hey ”;
    } 
}

Answer- Hello Hi

Solution Description

First if condition is true, so "Hello " will be printed. After that, next if condition will be evaluated (as both if's are independent if's) which is again true. Hence, next "Hi " will be printed (obviously in same line). We won't go inside else, as if is already executed
