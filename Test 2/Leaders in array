Given an integer array A of size n. Find and print all the leaders present in the input array. An array element A[i] is called Leader, if all the elements following it (i.e. present at its right) are less than or equal to A[i].
Print all the leader elements separated by space and in the same order they are present in the input array.


void Leaders(int* a,int len){
	for(int i=0;i<len;i++){
		int count=0;
		for(int j=i+1;j<len;j++){
			if(a[i]>=a[j]){
				count++;
			}else{
				break;
			}
		}
		if(count==len-i-1){
			cout<<a[i]<<" ";
		}
	}
}
